## State Management (source this in every lifecycle command)

### Reading State

At the START of every lifecycle command (`/feature`, `/develop`, `/quick-fix`, `/hotfix`, `/staging`, `/release`):

1. Check if `.state.md` exists at the repository root
2. If it exists, read the current state:
   ```bash
   # Quick state check
   grep -A1 "track" .state.md | tail -1 | awk '{print $NF}'
   grep -A1 "step" .state.md | tail -1 | awk '{print $NF}'
   grep -A1 "status" .state.md | tail -1 | awk '{print $NF}'
   ```
3. If the state shows a different track is in progress, WARN the user:
   > "There's already a [track] in progress on branch [branch] (issue #[id]). Do you want to continue that work, or start fresh?"
4. If `.state.md` doesn't exist, create it from the template with status `idle`

### Writing State

At the END of every lifecycle command, update `.state.md`:

1. Update the `Current Work` table with current values
2. Update `Status` table — set `status`, clear/set `blockers`, set `next_command`
3. Append a line to the `History` section:
   ```markdown
   - [YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM] `/command-name` — status: result (brief summary)
   ```

### Track → Step → Next Command Mapping

| Track | Step Sequence | Next Command |
|-------|--------------|-------------|
| feature | feature → develop → staging → release → idle | `/develop` → `/staging` → `/release` → done |
| quick-fix | quick-fix → staging → release → idle | `/staging` → `/release` → done |
| hotfix | hotfix → idle | done |

### Status Values

| Status | Meaning | Allowed Next Actions |
|--------|---------|---------------------|
| `idle` | No work in progress | Start any track |
| `in-progress` | Command is currently running | Wait or resume |
| `blocked` | Cannot proceed, needs intervention | Fix blocker, then `/next` |
| `awaiting-review` | Code review or approval needed | Review, then `/next` |
| `ready-to-promote` | Ready for next environment | `/staging` or `/release` |

## Label projection (GitHub)

`.state.md` is the source of truth. Every state mutation also writes a matching `state:*` label on the parent Issue so the state is visible on the web UI.

```bash
# Source these helpers at the top of any lifecycle command:
#   . commands/_shared/load-config.md
#   . commands/_shared/github-labels.md

# Set both .state.md status AND the issue's state:* label
set_state() {
  local issue_number="$1"
  local new_state="$2"   # one of: idle, in-progress, blocked, awaiting-review, ready-to-promote

  # 1) Update .state.md
  if [ -f .state.md ]; then
    sed -i.bak -E "s/^status:.*/status: ${new_state}/" .state.md && rm -f .state.md.bak
  fi

  # 2) Project to label (idle = no state:* label)
  if [ "$new_state" = "idle" ]; then
    set_state_label "$issue_number" ""
  else
    set_state_label "$issue_number" "$new_state"
  fi
}

# Reconcile on command start — if .state.md disagrees with label, .state.md wins.
reconcile_state() {
  local issue_number="$1"
  local md_state
  md_state="$(awk -F': *' '/^status:/{print $2; exit}' .state.md 2>/dev/null || echo idle)"
  set_state "$issue_number" "$md_state"
}
```
