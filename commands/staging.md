# /staging — Promote to Staging Environment

> **Expert Voice:** QA Engineer — verification-focused, runs E2E tests, checks regressions, ensures quality gates are met before production.

You are a QA Engineer promoting code from the develop branch to the staging environment. Your job is to merge, trigger the pipeline, verify the deployment, and report the status. You do NOT write code.

## Step 1: Load Configuration

Source `commands/_shared/load-config.md` to authenticate with GitHub and resolve `GITHUB_OWNER` / `GITHUB_REPO`.

Also load optional staging-specific vars from `.env.claude`:

```bash
export STAGING_URL=$(grep STAGING_URL .env.claude 2>/dev/null | cut -d '=' -f2 || true)
export ISSUE=$(awk -F': *' '/^issue:/{print $2; exit}' .state.md 2>/dev/null || true)
```

## Step 2: Read State

Read `.state.md` to verify we're in the right workflow step:

```bash
cat .state.md
```

Verify:
- Status is `ready-to-promote` OR this is a manual invocation (status is `idle`)
- If a different track is in progress, warn the user before proceeding

## Step 3: Pre-flight Checks

Before merging, verify:

1. **Current branch status:**
   ```bash
   git status
   git log develop --oneline -5
   ```
2. **Develop branch has commits ahead of staging:**
   ```bash
   git log staging..develop --oneline
   ```
   If no commits ahead, report "Nothing to promote — develop and staging are in sync." and stop.

3. **All tests pass on develop:**
   ```bash
   git checkout develop
   npm test 2>&1 || echo "TESTS FAILED"
   ```
   If tests fail, call `set_state "$ISSUE" "blocked"` (from `commands/_shared/state-management.md`) with blocker description and stop.

## Step 4: Open PR and Merge Develop into Staging

Create a PR via the `gh` CLI and then merge it:

```bash
gh pr create \
  --base staging \
  --head develop \
  --title "release: develop → staging" \
  --body "Automated promotion of develop to staging."
```

Then merge after any required reviews pass:

```bash
git checkout staging
git merge develop --no-ff -m "chore: promote develop to staging"
```

If merge conflicts occur:
1. Report the conflicting files
2. Call `set_state "$ISSUE" "blocked"` with blocker "merge conflicts in: [files]"
3. Stop and ask the user to resolve conflicts manually

## Step 5: Push and Monitor Pipeline

```bash
git push origin staging
```

If a GitHub Actions workflow runs on push to `staging`, wait for it:

```bash
gh run list --branch staging --limit 1
gh run watch
```

Report pipeline status: succeeded, failed, or timed out.

If no workflow is configured, skip pipeline monitoring and report:
> "No staging workflow found. Push completed — verify deployment manually at $STAGING_URL"

## Step 6: Verify Deployment

If `STAGING_URL` is set:
1. Wait 30 seconds for deployment to propagate
2. Check if the staging URL responds:
   ```bash
   curl -s -o /dev/null -w "%{http_code}" $STAGING_URL
   ```
3. Report the HTTP status code

If `STAGING_URL` is not set, skip and note:
> "No STAGING_URL configured. Verify deployment manually."

## Step 7: Run E2E Tests (if available)

Check if E2E tests exist:
```bash
ls e2e/ 2>/dev/null || ls tests/e2e/ 2>/dev/null || echo "NO_E2E"
```

If E2E tests exist and `STAGING_URL` is set:
```bash
PLAYWRIGHT_BASE_URL=$STAGING_URL npm run test:e2e 2>&1
```

Report test results. If tests fail, note which tests failed but do NOT block promotion — E2E failures on staging are informational, not blocking.

## Step 8: Update State

Call `set_state "$ISSUE" "ready-to-promote"` (from `commands/_shared/state-management.md`), then update `.state.md` directly:
- `step`: `staging`
- `status`: `ready-to-promote`
- `next_command`: `/release`
- Append to History: `- [date time] /staging — status: completed (merged develop to staging, [pipeline status], [test results])`

## Step 9: Return to Develop

```bash
git checkout develop
```

## Step 10: Summary Report

```
/staging — Promotion Complete
==============================
Repo: $GITHUB_OWNER/$GITHUB_REPO
Environment: Staging

[DONE] Merged develop → staging (N commits)
[DONE|SKIP] Pipeline: succeeded | not configured
[DONE|SKIP] Deployment verified: HTTP [status] at $STAGING_URL
[DONE|SKIP] E2E tests: N passed, M failed | not available

Next: Run /release to promote to production, or /next to auto-advance.
```
